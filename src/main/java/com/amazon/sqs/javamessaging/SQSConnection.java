/**
 * This is a logical connection entity, which encapsulates the logic to create
 * sessions.
 * <P>
 * Supports concurrent use, but the session objects it creates do no support
 * concurrent use.
 * <P>
 * The authentication does not take place with the creation of connection. It
 * takes place when the <code>amazonSQSClient</code> is used to call any SQS
 * API.
 * <P>
 * The physical connections are handled by the underlying
 * <code>amazonSQSClient</code>.
 * <P>
 * A JMS client typically creates a connection, one or more sessions, and a
 * number of message producers and consumers. When a connection is created, it
 * is in stopped mode. That means that no messages are being delivered, but
 * message producer can send messages while a connection is stopped.
 * <P>
 * Although the connection can be started immediately, it is typical to leave
 * the connection in stopped mode until setup is complete (that is, until all
 * message consumers have been created). At that point, the client calls the
 * connection's <code>start</code> method, and messages begin arriving at the
 * connection's consumers. This setup convention minimizes any client confusion
 * that may result from asynchronous message delivery while the client is still
 * in the process of setting itself up.
 * <P>
 * A connection can be started immediately, and the setup can be done
 * afterwards. Clients that do this must be prepared to handle asynchronous
 * message delivery while they are still in the process of setting up.
 * <P>
 * Transacted sessions are not supported.
 * <P>
 * Exception listener on connection is not supported.
